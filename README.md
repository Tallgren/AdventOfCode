# AdventOfCode

Advent of Code
This is a collection of my Advent of Code projects.

The website for the problems and descriptions can be found at https://adventofcode.com/ (enter what year e.g adventofcode.com/2022)

All days has a part 1 and part 2. Part 2 unlocks after finishing part 1 so often the code has to be rewritten and improved

I've done most problems in java but also tried some kotlin solutions
