<h1>Advent of Code</h1>

<p>This is a collection of my Advent of Code projects. </p>
<p>The website for the problems and descriptions can be found at https://adventofcode.com/ (enter what year e.g adventofcode.com/2022)</p>
<p>All days has a part 1 and part 2. Part 2 unlocks after finishing part 1 so often the code has to be rewritten and improved</p>
<p>I've done most problems in java but also tried some kotlin solutions</p>
